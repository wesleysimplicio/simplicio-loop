"""Adversarial/security + chaos suite for the Prototype-First gate (issue #568 epic).

Targets `simplicio_loop/prototype_gate.py` and, where the CLI is the actual attack
surface (malformed/untrusted input), `simplicio_loop/prototype_cli.py`. This repo does
not yet ship `prototype_fanout.py` / `prototype_judge.py` (candidate fan-out execution
and judge-LLM integration are explicitly out of the P0 slice per the module docstring),
so any of the eight categories below that genuinely depends on those modules is marked
`pytest.mark.skip` with a `# TODO(deferred): needs <module>` comment instead of being
faked green. Every non-skipped test asserts a real, breakable invariant -- none of them
degenerate to `assert True`.

Covers, from the epic's mandatory adversarial list:
  1. prompt injection tenta dispensar gate
  2. candidate acessa secret/dado real                          -- DEFERRED (no policy field yet)
  3. symlink/path traversal no artifact store
  4. forged decision/receipt
  5. creator se apresenta como judge                             -- partially DEFERRED
  6. prototype tenta efeito externo
  7. budget/slot exhaustion                                       -- DEFERRED (no enforcement yet)
  8. malicious artifact e unsafe promotion / corrupted candidate

And from the chaos-style "Testes obrigatórios" list, scoped to what this module owns:
  - crash/restart em cada boundary
  - candidate artifact corrompido
