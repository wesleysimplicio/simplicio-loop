"""Deterministic, offline unit coverage for ``simplicio_loop.merge_executor.MergeExecutor``.

Uses a scripted fake ``runner`` (no network, no real `gh`) to prove: idempotent PR creation,
mergeable-state polling (success / conflict / timeout), a full merge + remote reconciliation
happy path, a merge command that fails, and a merge command that exits 0 but the remote
re-query disagrees (the "don't trust the exit code" gap #288 calls out).

See ``tests/test_merge_executor_live_e2e.py`` for the real, non-mocked `gh`-backed e2e against
disposable scratch branches.
