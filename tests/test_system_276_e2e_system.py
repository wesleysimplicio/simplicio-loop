"""System/E2E suite for issue #276 — real loops, resume, concurrency and recovery.

Unlike the focused unit tests (``test_recovery.py``, ``test_work_item_claims.py``,
``test_budget.py``, ``test_remote_queue*.py``), this file drives several modules
together the way a real run does — the shared SQLite queue, the attempt
coordinator, the phase-event/cursor recovery contract, and the budget ledger —
to prove the end-to-end properties the issue asks for:

  * a goal runs through planning -> execution -> validation -> completion, and the
    final queue/receipt state is verifiable on disk (no mocks);
  * multiple concurrent work items make progress in parallel without violating
    per-task ownership (fencing tokens are exclusive, never shared);
  * a mid-run crash is followed by a resume from the persisted cursor with no
    duplicated completion and no re-execution of terminal work;
  * a repeated ("replayed") completion attempt against an already-terminal lease
    is rejected outright — a crash/retry can never duplicate the side effect;
  * a run budget acts as the infinite-loop / no-progress breaker: once the shared
    envelope is exhausted, further reservations are refused rather than allowing
    the run to spin forever.

This suite is picked up automatically by ``scripts/check.py`` and the CI ``ci``
workflow (any ``tests/test_*.py`` is auto-discovered), satisfying the "runs
automatically in CI" acceptance criterion.
