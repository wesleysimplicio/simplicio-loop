"""Epic #498 end-to-end: ProcessSpec through the real Hub IPC boundary.

Proves the "unica fronteira" (single boundary) claim across the pieces that #514 (ProcessSpec/
Lease contract), #515 (Rust/Tokio backend), and #516 (enforcement/observability registry) each
landed in isolation, by driving them together through ``HubDaemon.handle(method="execute")`` --
the real IPC path a client actually calls, not ``process_supervisor``/``process_supervisor_rust``
called directly.

Two things are proven, both against a real spawned OS process (not a mock):

1. A ProcessSpec submitted via ``execute`` runs to completion through whichever backend is
   present -- the Rust binary when built (skipped, not faked, if the crate was never compiled in
   this checkout) and explicitly also through the Python fallback (forced via monkeypatch so the
   same assertions run even when Rust is unavailable).
2. While that process is alive, it is visible in the enforcement layer's ``ProcessRegistry`` --
   i.e. the Hub's execute path now registers the real pid with the same bookkeeping
   ``process_enforcement.detect_unsupervised`` diffs against -- and is unregistered the moment
   ``execute`` returns. A spec deliberately not routed through Hub (spawned by hand) is used as a
   negative control to show the registry only reflects Hub-supervised pids, not every process on
   the host.
