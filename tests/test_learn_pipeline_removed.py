"""#69: the write-only learn pipeline (`hooks/learn_stop.py` enqueuing
`.orchestrator/learn/pending.jsonl`) had no consumer anywhere in the repo — markers went in,
nothing ever came out. Chosen fix: remove the producer everywhere (Option B from the issue) rather
than build a consumer for a queue nothing reads. This pins that removal so the hook, and its
wiring, cannot silently reappear half-wired.
