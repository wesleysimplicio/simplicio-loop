"""Chaos coverage for issue #288's restart/recovery gap, one level up from
``tests/test_work_item_claims_run_guarded.py`` (which proves ``run_guarded`` kills its own
child subprocess on lease loss). Here the *whole worker process* is killed -- not merely its
guarded subprocess -- simulating a real crash/OOM-kill/eviction with no graceful release, no
final heartbeat, nothing. This proves the fencing/lease design survives that, end to end:

  1. A real, separate Python **process** claims a work item against a shared on-disk SQLite
     queue and then goes silent (no heartbeat) -- simulating a worker that crashed mid-task.
  2. The parent test **kills that process** (``proc.kill()`` -- SIGKILL-equivalent, no chance
     to run cleanup code), well before the lease TTL would naturally expire from inactivity.
  3. Once the TTL elapses, a **second claimant** (different identity, same queue) can claim
     the same work item -- recovery works, nothing is stuck.
  4. The second claimant completes the work item for real.
  5. The **first (dead) worker's lease can never complete anything** afterward: replaying its
     exact lease/fencing token against ``complete()`` raises ``QueueConflict`` -- proving no
     double-completion is possible even if the killed process had a zombie thread or a retry
     queued up somewhere that eventually fired.
  6. The queue's own event log shows the work item completed **exactly once**, by the second
     claimant's fencing token -- not two completions racing.
