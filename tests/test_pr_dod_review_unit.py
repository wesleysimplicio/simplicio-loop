"""Unit tests for scripts/pr_dod_review.py — PR review against DoD + issue acceptance criteria.

Built so a session that finds all open issues already claimed by other agents can still
contribute value: mechanically checking whether an open PR satisfies CLAUDE.md's 7-dimension
Definition of Done and the issue's own frozen acceptance-criteria checklist, instead of a
vibe-based approval.
