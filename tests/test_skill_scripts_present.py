"""Regression test for runtime#3304 — SKILL.md must not promise a worker the shipped
plugin doesn't have.

`.claude/skills/simplicio-loop/SKILL.md` describes the mechanized protocol by shelling out to
`scripts/<name>.py` (and `hooks/<name>.py`) paths. `scripts/mirror_manifest.py`'s `LEAN_SCRIPTS`/
`LEAN_HOOKS` decide what `scripts/sync_plugin.py` copies into `plugin/scripts/`+`plugin/hooks/` —
the actual marketplace-plugin mirror an installed user gets. If a script SKILL.md references
drops out of that lean list, the shipped skill breaks with an `ImportError`/`FileNotFoundError`
the first time it tries to invoke that worker, even though the repo-root `scripts/` copy works
fine. This test parses SKILL.md's own references and asserts every one of them actually exists in
`plugin/scripts/`+`plugin/hooks/`, so that regression fails loudly here instead of silently
shipping.
