# MCP setup — `simplicio-runtime` across every host

`simplicio-runtime` (binary `simplicio`, MCP subcommand `simplicio serve --mcp --stdio`,
installed via `pip install -U simplicio-installer && simplicio install --global`) is an optional
native integration on every adapter in this repo. When it is missing or unreachable, the loop
continues with `simplicio-mapper`/`simplicio-dev-cli` and reports that runtime-specific
integrations were skipped.

This page is the single skimmable entry point for wiring the bind on any of the 15 hosts this
repo documents. Each row's config differs by host — read the linked adapter section for the exact
file, snippet, and verification step; don't copy a snippet from the wrong host.

Universal verification, works from any host's terminal once the binary is installed:

```bash
simplicio doctor --json | grep -A2 mcp-host-registration
```

## Host table

| Host | MCP config file | Status | Adapter section |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` (`mcpServers`) or project `.mcp.json` | **verified** (Tier 1, gated) | [claude/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/claude/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Codex | `~/.codex/config.toml` (`[mcp_servers.simplicio]`) | **verified** (Tier 1, gated) | [codex/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/codex/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (`mcpServers`) | **verified** (Tier 1, gated) | [cursor/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/cursor/README.md#mcp-config) |
| VS Code (Copilot) | `.vscode/mcp.json` (`servers`) / `%APPDATA%\Code\User\mcp.json` etc. (user-global) | **verified** (Tier 2, installer-written, not per-commit gated) | [vscode/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/vscode/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Antigravity | IDE MCP settings (path not confirmed against a live install) | **best-effort** | [antigravity/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/antigravity/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Orca Dev | Orca's MCP/skills registry, or the inner agent's own config (Claude Code/Cursor) | **best-effort** (Tier 2; inner-agent config is verified where that inner agent is Tier 1) | [orca/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/orca/README.md#mcp-config) |
| OpenCode | `opencode.json` (`mcp`, `type: "local"`) | **best-effort** (documented upstream, not gated here) | [opencode/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/opencode/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json` or `~/.gemini/settings.json` (`mcpServers`) | **best-effort** (documented shape, not gated here) | [gemini/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/gemini/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Gemini Code Assist | IDE-level MCP settings (distinct from Gemini CLI's file) | **best-effort, not verified** | [gemini/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/gemini/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Kimi | no confirmed first-party MCP client; route via a wrapper's own config if applicable | **best-effort / community-reported, not gated** | [kimi/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/kimi/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Qwen (Code/CLI) | `.qwen/settings.json` (`mcpServers`, inherited from the Gemini CLI fork) | **best-effort, not verified** | [qwen/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/qwen/README.md#mcp-config) |
| DeepSeek | no first-party MCP client; route via a wrapper's own config (e.g. OpenCode) | **best-effort / community-reported, not gated** | [deepseek/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/deepseek/README.md#mcp-config) |
| Kiro | `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (`mcpServers`) | **best-effort** (installer-written, not per-commit gated) | [kiro/README.md#mcp-config](../adapters/kiro/README.md#mcp-config) |

Not in the table above because they have no host-level MCP client at all: **Aider** (LLM/git/gh
tool fallback), **Simplicio Agent** (native extension points, no MCP shim needed), **OpenClaw**
(native plugin SDK). See their adapter READMEs for optional runtime integration details.

## What "verified" vs "best-effort" means here

- **Verified (Tier 1, gated):** `scripts/verify_adapters.py <runtime>` runs this host's install
  contract on every commit (`scripts/claims_audit.py` check 7 runs the fast `claude` subset on
  every gate; the full Tier 1 set is `claude codex cursor`).
- **Verified (Tier 2, installer-written):** the installer (`scripts/install_lib.py` /
  `scripts/install.ps1`) actively writes this host's MCP config file and the shape is documented
  from that source, but it is not re-run on every commit.
- **Best-effort / community-reported, not gated:** the config shape is either inherited from a
  well-known upstream fork (Qwen ← Gemini CLI), or not independently confirmed against a real
  install in this repo (Antigravity, Gemini Code Assist, Kimi, DeepSeek). Treat these as a
  starting point, not a guarantee — confirm the exact field names against your installed version
  before relying on them, and prefer routing through a Tier 1/verified wrapper's MCP client where
  one is available (e.g. an OpenCode or Claude Code front-end configured against a Kimi/DeepSeek
  model).

## Installing the bind (any host)

```bash
pip install -U simplicio-installer && simplicio install --global
simplicio doctor --json | grep -A2 mcp-host-registration
```

`simplicio install --global` writes the Claude/Codex/Cursor/VS Code/Kiro configs directly where
present; hosts without a native client detected by the installer need the manual snippet from
their adapter section above.
