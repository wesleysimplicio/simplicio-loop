# Scripts inventory — core vs satellite (#118)

This is a maintainer-curated inventory of the gate-relevant boundaries, not a count or a
classification of every utility under `scripts/`: **core** is required for the
`/simplicio-loop` drive or the local `check.py` gate, while **satellite** is opt-in/advanced (a
source adapter, an extension point not wired into the base loop, or a separate economy/demo
stack). The checkout and its latest local gate receipt are authoritative for inventory and result
counts; `scripts/test_categories.py` reports any tests that remain uncategorized.
`scripts/check.py --core-gate` runs the mandatory local gate: claims audit, mirror parity, core pytest selection,
loop contract, clean-environment contract, token/repository budgets, and portable stage-contract
validation. The default `scripts/check.py` uses the same phases with the full core+satellite pytest
selection. GitHub Actions is not required or accepted as evidence for either mode; the local
result is authoritative.

Status legend: **active** (invoked today, tested), **experimental** (tested but not yet wired to
any skill/doc invoker), **legacy** (superseded, kept for compatibility/history).

## Core (required for the loop drive or the local gate)

| Script | Invoker | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `check.py` | manual (`python3 scripts/check.py`) · git pre-push hook (fail-closed) · local result is authoritative; GitHub Actions is not required evidence | active |

| `package_content_check.py` | explicit `check.py --package-content` release lane; not part of default/core because it builds real artifacts | active |

## Satellite (opt-in / advanced capabilities)

| Script | Invoker | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `issue_meta_audit.py` | manual read-only GitHub specification audit for issue #647; supports deterministic offline fixtures and writes `docs/audits/` evidence | active |

| `simplicio-engine` | wrapper CLI around the capture/economy stack (`simplicio-engine doctor`, etc.) | active |
| `fan_out.py` | parallel task distribution — tested (`selftest` registered in `claims_audit.py`) but no documented invoker in any skill/reference doc yet | experimental |
| `blast-radius.sh` | none found — no reference in README/AGENTS/CLAUDE/skill docs, no test coverage; a shell-based selective-test-runner that predates (and overlaps with) `impact_audit.py`/`flow_audit.py` | legacy — candidate for removal or for being wired into `check.py --core-gate` in a follow-up issue, not decided here |

## How this maps to `scripts/check.py`

- `scripts/check.py` (no flags) — claims audit + mirror parity + full pytest suite excluding the
  marked `external_integration` lane + loop contract + clean-env + token budget + repository
  budget + portable contract validation. A marker-only pytest `--collect-only` probe reports the
  typed count as `EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION_EXCLUDED[marker_selection]=N` before execution.
- `scripts/check.py --core-gate` — the same mandatory phases with `SATELLITE_TEST_STEMS` removed
  (including the manual/snapshot `e2e_demo`, `check_e2e_demo_contract`, and
  `independent_watcher` suites) and `external_integration` deselected explicitly. Subprocess environment is allowlisted, pytest
  plugin autoload is disabled, and pytest plus Python descendants inheriting the gate environment
  allow only loopback/AF_UNIX sockets (arbitrary external CLIs are not network-sandboxed). The core
  has a 600-second global deadline, and every subprocess retains its shorter phase deadline.
- A zero pytest exit with no passed mandatory test is `pytest_all_tests_skipped`; missing pytest,
  test directories, or phase scripts fail with typed `*_unavailable`/`*_missing` reasons.
- External installed-runtime/live/sibling/release lanes are not core proof. The portable
  conformance phase validates only the shared graph/receipt fixture and reports zero external
  runtimes executed unless a separate real adapter lane supplies that evidence.
- `scripts/check.py --audit-only` / `--tests-only` / `--mirror-parity-only` /
  `--loop-contract-only` / `--clean-env-only` / `--token-budget` / `--repo-budget` /
  `--conformance` run the named local phase; `--package-content` is an explicit release lane.

Regenerating this table: there is no automated generator (it is maintainer-curated, cross-checked
against `scripts/claims_audit.py`'s `SELFTEST_SCRIPTS`/`SELFTEST_EXEMPT` and the doc references
each script's docstring/reference file points at). Re-verify it whenever a script is added,
removed, or its invoker changes.
