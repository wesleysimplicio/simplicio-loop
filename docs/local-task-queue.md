# Durable local task queue

`LocalTaskQueue` composes the existing `SQLiteRemoteQueue` database under `.simplicio/orchestrator/queue.sqlite3`; it does not create a parallel broker. The inherited task, lease, fencing, idempotency and event tables remain authoritative. Versioned local tables add dependencies, outcomes, intent/receipts and append-only transitions.

Supported outcomes are `never_started`, `running`, `unknown_outcome`, `verified_success`, `retryable_failure`, `blocked` and `dead_letter`. Unknown effects require reconciliation, and retries require idempotency provenance. STOP blocks claims and requests bounded cooperative cancellation. Terminal GC requires released generation/worktree resources.

Operator commands are JSON: `simplicio-loop queue --repo <path> status|top|inspect|cancel|drain|resume|doctor|reclaim|gc`.

Run the benchmark with `python -m bench.benchmark_local_task_queue_889`; it measures 1, 10, 100 and 1000 queued tasks.
The benchmark exits non-zero when per-task enqueue or claim latency exceeds its configurable thresholds.
The queue CLI accepts only a resolved Git worktree root for `--repo`; library callers may still use isolated temporary roots.
