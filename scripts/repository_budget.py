"""simplicio-loop — Repository size budget guard (#294, step 1-2 of the governance plan).

`.claude/skills/simplicio-loop` ships as a lean skill/adapter tree, but nothing in the local gate
noticed if a NEW commit added a large binary/media blob to the tracked working tree — the exact
failure mode the #294 audit flagged (README/PyPI/changelog claims aside, the tracked tree itself
can silently balloon one big video/screenshot at a time). This guard is scoped deliberately
NARROW and SAFE: it measures and gates the CURRENT tracked working tree only. It never touches
git history, never rewrites refs, and never runs `git filter-repo` — that migration is called out
in the issue as requiring an explicit, separately-approved maintainer decision (backup, dry-run,
communicated window). This script is step 1 ("measure and classify") and step 2 ("stop new
commits from making it worse") of that plan; the history-rewrite step is intentionally NOT here.

What it does:
  - lists every git-tracked file with its on-disk size (`git ls-files` + `os.stat`, so it reads
    the current worktree, not blobs from old history);
  - reports the N largest tracked files (default 20) — the "biggest blobs" report the issue asks
    to "publish before any rewrite";
  - enforces a **per-file** hard cap (`MAX_SINGLE_FILE_BYTES`) for any NEW file that was not
    already over the cap in the committed baseline (catches "someone just committed a 40MB
    video") — pre-existing oversized files (e.g. the doc hero images already in the tree) are
    grandfathered by the baseline so this gate does not retroactively fail on history it did not
    create, but they may not grow past `THRESHOLD_GROWTH` themselves either;
  - enforces a **total tracked tree** budget via a committed baseline
    (`scripts/repository_budget_baseline.json`), same pattern as `scripts/token_budget.py` (#121):
    growth past `THRESHOLD_GROWTH` over the last deliberately-reviewed baseline fails the gate.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/repository_budget.py                    # report + gate against the baseline
    python3 scripts/repository_budget.py --check             # same, quiet unless it fails
    python3 scripts/repository_budget.py --update-baseline   # regenerate the baseline after a
                                                               # deliberate, reviewed size change
    python3 scripts/repository_budget.py --top 20             # report N largest tracked files

Exit codes: 0 = within budget, 1 = budget exceeded (total growth or a single oversized file).
