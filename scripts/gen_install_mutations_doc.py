"""Generate `docs/INSTALL_MUTATIONS.md` from a single in-code data structure (#293 §7,
"gerar tabela de efeitos a partir do manifest do instalador").

Before this script, the doc was hand-maintained prose kept in sync with `install_lib.py` /
`install_plan.py` / `install_executor.py` / `install_services.py` by discipline alone — exactly
the kind of promise-vs-reality drift issue #293 calls out ("divergência entre as sete skills
anunciadas e o conjunto tratado pelo caminho do instalador"). Now the mutation inventory, the
OS-differences matrix, and the consent matrix are all rendered from `MUTATIONS` / `OS_DIFFS` /
`_consent_rows()` below — the same constants `install_plan.py`'s `_permissions_required()` logic
mirrors — so a future change to what requires consent can't silently leave the doc stale:
`scripts/claims_audit.py`'s `check_install_mutations_doc` re-renders this module and fails the
gate if `docs/INSTALL_MUTATIONS.md` on disk differs by a single byte.

Also emits `docs/install-mutations.json` (schema `simplicio.install-mutations/v1`) from the exact
SAME `MUTATIONS`/`OS_DIFFS`/`_consent_rows()` data — a structured, machine-readable rendering for
a third consumer that shouldn't have to scrape markdown tables (#293 gap: "machine-readable
effects manifest").

Usage:
    python3 scripts/gen_install_mutations_doc.py            # regenerate .md + .json in place
    python3 scripts/gen_install_mutations_doc.py --json      # print the JSON manifest to stdout
    python3 scripts/gen_install_mutations_doc.py --check     # exit 1 if either file has drifted
