"""simplicio-loop — single source of truth for the "lean mirror" sets (#74).

`scripts/sync_plugin.py` (writes `plugin/`) and `scripts/claims_audit.py` (validates
`simplicio_loop/_bundle/` and `plugin/` parity) previously hard-coded the SAME lean subset of
hooks/scripts/tests independently. Editing one and forgetting the other let the syncer copy one
set while the auditor validated another — drift that passed the gate silently. This module is the
ONE place those sets are declared; both consumers import from here.

No behavior of its own — pure data, imported by `sync_plugin.py` and `claims_audit.py`.
