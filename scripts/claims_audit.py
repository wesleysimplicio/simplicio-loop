"""simplicio-loop — claims audit (turn asserted docs into checked facts; fail-closed).

The repo makes many claims in prose. This audits the mechanical ones so a doc can't drift away from
the code. Deterministic, stdlib-only, no network. Exits 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise —
so it can gate a commit/push (`scripts/check.py`, or a git pre-push hook). NOT a GitHub Action;
runs locally, free.

Thirteen checks:
  1. referenced-scripts-exist  Every `scripts/<name>.py` mentioned in the docs actually exists.
  2. extension-point-count      Every "<N> extension points / named (binding) points" figure agrees
                                with EACH OTHER *and* with the actual row count of the extension-points
                                table in extension-points.md (the source of truth, not just consensus).
  3. cited-commands-run         Each doc-cited worker script is invokable: its `selftest` passes if
                                it has one, else it `py_compile`s and prints usage cleanly. Also a
                                meta-check: every `scripts/*.py` that defines a `selftest` subcommand
                                must be registered here (a selftest the gate never runs is worse than
                                none — its presence implies coverage that doesn't exist).
  4. bundle-parity              Every shipped file under `.claude/skills/`, `hooks/`, the bundled
                                runtime helper `scripts/`, and bundled parity `tests/` is
                                byte-identical under `simplicio_loop/_bundle/` — checked in BOTH
                                directions, so an orphan left behind in `_bundle/` after a source
                                rename/delete is caught too (not just a forward source->bundle walk).
  5. plugin-parity              The lean marketplace plugin tree mirrors the source files it ships
                                (skills + wired hooks + runtime helper scripts + parity tests).
  6. skill-count                Every "<N> skills" claim agrees with the actual `.claude/skills/*/
                                SKILL.md` count.
  7. adapter-install-contract   `scripts/verify_adapters.py claude` — a fast, representative subset
                                of the full 11-runtime installer e2e (`verify_adapters.py` with no
                                args) — proves the install contract isn't dead assurance. Run the
                                full sweep manually / in a slower CI job; it is too slow (~45s per
                                runtime) for this fast local gate.
  8. quantitative-claims        Every quantitative number in README/SKILLs has a corresponding entry
                                in `scripts/claims_manifest.py` with a receipt or "unverified" label.
                                Unknown/missing numbers => check red. Any claim marked "verified"
                                must additionally cite a receipt bound to a REAL commit reachable
                                in this repo's git history (`commit` + `generated_at`/`created_at`
                                fields) — a fabricated or foreign-commit receipt is rejected (#294).
  9. prose-commands-valid       Every doc-cited worker invocation (flags + verbs) is validated against
                                the worker's real CLI via `--describe-cli`. Workers that emit
                                `--describe-cli` JSON are checked for flag existence; divergences are
                                reported with file:line.
  10. skill-pair-parity         Shared references under `.claude/skills/simplicio-loop/` and
                                `.claude/skills/simplicio-tasks/` are byte-identical for every file
                                that exists in BOTH `references/` trees (the tasks tree is a
                                deliberate subset; `SKILL.md` differs by design and is excluded).
  11. turn-header-format        `loop_progress.py render --turn-header` output still matches the
                                documented contract shape.
  12. install-mutations-doc     `docs/INSTALL_MUTATIONS.md` matches its generator.
  13. canonical-manifest        `scripts/canonical_manifest.py check` (#294 AC6/AC7): version
                                (release_manifest), skill count, and CHANGELOG.md's latest
                                released version all agree, AND the runtime/adapter count in
                                README/adapters/MATRIX.md agrees with the actual `adapters/` tree
                                (legacy compat shims collapsed to their canonical runtime).
