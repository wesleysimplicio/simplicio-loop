"""simplicio-loop — continuous-evolution coordinator (MVP core of GH #467).

GH #467 asks for a full "Continuous Evolution" coordinator: discover/classify/prioritize
improvement opportunities, open/route GitHub issues for them, enforce a budget across whole
runs, and render an RFC. This worker is deliberately the **genuine, working MVP CORE only** —
GitHub issue creation/routing, budget enforcement across whole runs, and RFC rendering are
explicitly OUT of scope for this slice and tracked in a follow-up issue. What this gives you:

  1. An `EvolutionProposal` record — a classified, deduplicated improvement opportunity (NOT a
     defect/regression — see the DEFECT GUARD below), keyed by a stable **fingerprint** so
     near-identical proposals collapse into ONE record instead of N duplicates.
  2. A **DEFECT GUARD**: `propose()` REFUSES (returns an error result, never raises) any
     `class in ("defect", "regression")` — "o coordenador não pode rotular defeito como
     melhoria" (GH #467). Bugs/regressions belong in `scripts/finding_collector.py`'s finding->issue
     lifecycle, not here.
  3. Deterministic, EXPLAINABLE priority scoring (`compute_priority`): a pure function of fixed
     impact/effort/risk weights — no randomness, no LLM call, same inputs always produce the
     same score. The raw impact/effort/risk values are stored alongside the score so a report
     can show "why" a proposal ranked where it did.
  4. Dedup by fingerprint (sha256 of component+class+normalized(problem), reusing
     `finding_collector.py:normalize_signature` so a symptom/problem string collapses the same way in
     both stores) — a repeat proposal for the SAME (component, class, problem) updates the
     existing record instead of creating a new one.
  5. A per-run BUDGET (`--budget-max`, default 20): refuses to grow the store past N DISTINCT
     fingerprints ever recorded. Simplification (documented, MVP scope): the cap counts every
     fingerprint ever written to `proposals.jsonl` regardless of state or date, NOT just
     "proposals created today" — tracking a rolling per-day window is left to the follow-up
     issue alongside GitHub issue creation.
  6. `list` / `report` / `doctor` — read-only views: the deduped proposals, an "Evolution
     Ledger" summary by class/state (counts + top proposals by priority), and a store
     sanity check.

Deterministic and model-free: `compute_priority` + fingerprinting are pure functions (no I/O),
unit-testable in isolation, same discipline as `loop_journal.py:fingerprint()`,
`task_anchor.py:goal_fingerprint()`, and `finding_collector.py:compute_fingerprint()`.

State (override the directory with $SIMPLICIO_EVOLUTION_DIR):
    .orchestrator/evolution/proposals.jsonl   one JSON record per proposal, keyed by fingerprint
                                               (rewritten in place on update — NOT append-only,
                                               same discipline as finding_collector.py's store)

EvolutionProposal fields: proposal_id, fingerprint, class, component, problem, benefit, impact,
effort, risk, priority_score, state, created_at, updated_at, occurrences.

class   one of: defect|regression|improvement|evolution|optimization|hardening|discovery|
                maintenance   (defect/regression are REFUSED by propose() — see DEFECT GUARD)
impact  one of: low|medium|high|critical
effort  one of: low|medium|high
risk    one of: low|medium|high
state   one of: observed|validated|issue-created|linked|deferred|rejected|delivered

Priority scoring (see `compute_priority`):
    priority_score = impact_weight*W1 + (1/effort_weight)*W2 - risk_weight*W3
    W1=10.0 (impact), W2=5.0 (effort, inverted so LOW effort scores higher), W3=3.0 (risk)
    impact_weight:  low=1 medium=2 high=3 critical=4
    effort_weight:  low=1 medium=2 high=3
    risk_weight:    low=1 medium=2 high=3

Verbs:
  propose   Create or update a proposal. --class --component --problem --benefit --impact
            --effort --risk are required. REFUSES (exit 2, state unchanged) if --class is
            defect/regression (defect guard) or if the budget cap would be exceeded (state
            "rejected", reason "budget_exceeded") on a genuinely NEW fingerprint.
            --budget-max N overrides the default cap of 20 distinct fingerprints.
            Prints the resulting record + {"created": true/false} with --json.
  list      Print all proposals (deduped, one per fingerprint) as a JSON array with --json.
  report    Print the "Evolution Ledger": counts by class/state + top proposals by
            priority_score, with --json.
  doctor    Sanity-check the store (file exists/parseable, no duplicate fingerprints with
            different proposal_id, stored priority_score matches a fresh recompute).
            --exit-code -> exit 1 if issues were found.
  selftest  Exercise propose/list/report/doctor plus the defect-guard and budget-cap paths.
            PASS/FAIL, exit 0/1.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/evolution.py propose --class improvement --component scripts/loop_progress.py \\
        --problem "status --json is O(n) rescans on every call" \\
