"""simplicio-loop — locked JSONL append + tolerant-count helpers (issue #127).

Multiple concurrent workers append to the SAME shared JSONL logs — the run journal
(`.orchestrator/loop/journal.jsonl`, `scripts/loop_journal.py`), the handoff event log
(`.orchestrator/handoffs/events.jsonl`, `scripts/handoff.py`), and (written by the external
`simplicio` runtime, only ever READ here) the savings ledger
(`.simplicio/ledger/savings-events.jsonl`, `hooks/simplicio_watch.py`). Without a lock, two
processes racing an ``open(path, "a").write()`` can interleave partial writes and corrupt a
line — a single torn line silently breaks every downstream reader (the stall detector, the
hierarchical planner, `pr_evidence.py`).

``locked_append_line`` is the ONE place any worker in this repo appends a line to a shared JSONL
log. Underscore-prefixed on purpose: it is an internal library helper, not a worker script — it
has no CLI, is not doc-cited, and is intentionally exempt from the `claims_audit.py` "every
`scripts/*.py` is either doc-cited or selftest-registered" sweep (leading `_` is the existing
convention for that, see `check_commands_run()`'s orphan scan).

Locking: POSIX uses ``fcntl.flock`` on a small sidecar ``<path>.lock`` file; Windows uses
``msvcrt.locking`` on the same sidecar. A sidecar (not the growing data file itself) keeps the
byte-range lock stable regardless of the data file's size. The write is ``flush()`` +
``os.fsync()`` BEFORE the lock is released, so a reader can never observe a half-flushed line.

Acquisition is bounded (default 2000ms) and FAIL-OPEN on timeout: the write is skipped entirely
(never partially written, never written without the lock) and a one-line degrade note goes to
stderr — a stuck/leaked lock must never wedge the caller.

``count_jsonl_lines`` is the matching tolerant-reader half: it counts valid vs. corrupt
(truncated/illegible) lines in a JSONL file without ever raising, for a summary line a reader can
surface instead of silently dropping the bad lines.

Usage (library only, no CLI):
    from _locked_append import locked_append_line, count_jsonl_lines
    ok = locked_append_line("/path/to/journal.jsonl", json.dumps(rec))
    valid, corrupt = count_jsonl_lines("/path/to/journal.jsonl")
