//! Model name → context window (tokens) lookup, sourced from LiteLLM.
//!
//! # Why LiteLLM and not a hand-rolled table
//!
//! Earlier drafts of this module hardcoded a small `if/else` chain
//! covering Claude / GPT-4o / GPT-3.5. Two failure modes that cost us:
//!
//! 1. **Static rot.** Anthropic and OpenAI ship new models monthly.
//!    A hardcoded table goes stale between Simplicio releases; new
//!    models silently fall through to a default that is often wrong.
//! 2. **Long tail.** Bedrock, Cohere, Mistral, Gemini, AzureML — each
//!    has dozens of model variants. We aren't going to maintain
//!    a comprehensive table by hand.
//!
//! [LiteLLM] maintains `model_prices_and_context_window.json` as a
//! community-curated source of truth: ~2000 chat models, refreshed
//! weekly, with `max_input_tokens` (the field we care about) plus
//! pricing, output limits, capability flags. Every other LLM-tool
//! ecosystem (Portkey, Helicone, OpenRouter, Continue) pulls from it.
//!
//! [LiteLLM]: https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm
//!
//! # Vendoring strategy
//!
//! We **check the JSON into the repo** at
//! `crates/simplicio-proxy/data/model_prices_and_context_window.json`
//! and `include_str!` it at compile time. Reasons over alternatives:
//!
//! - **Build-time fetch (`build.rs` + curl):** breaks for offline /
//!   air-gapped builds — bad for BYOC where customers may not allow
//!   outbound network during install.
//! - **Runtime fetch:** same problem, plus a startup-failure surface
//!   we don't need.
//!
//! Refresh is operator-driven: `scripts/refresh_model_limits.sh`
//! re-pulls and validates the JSON, the diff lands in a regular PR.
//! We trade "always fresh" for "deterministic, offline-buildable,
//! auditable in version control" — the right trade for a deploy
//! artifact that's expected to run in customer VPCs.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! The 1.4MB JSON parses in ~10ms one-time on first lookup. Parsed
//! result is cached in a `OnceLock<HashMap>` so subsequent lookups
//! are O(1). When `--compression` is off, the JSON is in the binary
//! image but never parsed — zero runtime cost.
//!
//! # Default for unknown models
//!
//! When a model isn't in the table, we return a conservative 128K
//! and emit a `tracing::warn!` (once per unknown model id). 128K is
//! the dominant context window across modern frontier models; being
//! wrong here means we either over-compress (safe — we just trim
//! unnecessarily, the request still works) or under-compress (the
//! upstream rejects it with `context_length_exceeded`, which is
//! recoverable by the client).
