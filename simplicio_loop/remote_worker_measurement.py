"""Tri-state remote-worker capability measurement for `scripts/doctor.py` (issue #286).

The loop's remote-worker protocol (`simplicio.remote-worker/v2`,
`docs/REMOTE_QUEUE.md`) can be exercised entirely on one machine — the repo's own
test suite proves the wire contract with real, separate OS processes talking over
a real HTTP socket (`tests/test_remote_worker_http_e2e.py`). That is real evidence
the *protocol* works, but it is not the same claim as "a task created on one
physical device was discovered/claimed/executed by a worker on a different
physical device" — the epic's actual acceptance criterion. `doctor.py` must never
blur those two things together, so it reports three distinct states instead of a
single "remote worker: ok/fail" boolean:

  LOCAL_ONLY      -- no remote queue destination is configured
                     (`SIMPLICIO_REMOTE_QUEUE_URL` / `SIMPLICIO_REMOTE_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
                     both unset). The loop only ever dispatches in-process /
                     same-host. This is the default and is NOT a failure.
  REMOTE_READY    -- a remote queue destination is configured, but this checkout
                     has never recorded a passing cross-process proof. Configured,
                     unproven.
  REMOTE_MEASURED -- a real proof has actually run and recorded a measurement
                     receipt via `record_measurement()`. Only ever set by a proof
                     that genuinely passed in the current process -- never
                     inferred from source code merely existing, and never
                     upgraded to "physical multi-machine" without a human
                     recording that tier explicitly (see ACCEPTED_PROOFS).

`scripts/remote_worker_measurement.py` is the CLI: `status` prints the tri-state,
`record` re-runs an accepted proof for real and only writes the receipt if it
actually passed, `clear` deletes the receipt to force a fresh re-proof.
