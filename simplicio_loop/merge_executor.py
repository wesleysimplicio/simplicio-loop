"""Merge executor (issue #288): once a claimed task's worktree work is VERIFIED
(``simplicio_loop.receipt_verifier.verify_receipt`` passes), actually perform the merge --
create the PR (idempotent), poll for a mergeable state, merge it, and then *reconcile*
against the remote afterward instead of trusting the merge command's exit code alone.

Formalizes, as a reusable, testable primitive, the ad-hoc ``gh pr create`` / ``gh pr merge
--squash --delete-branch`` pattern this project's own delivery workflow already performs by
hand at the end of every task (see CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md "Process" sections) -- the epic-288
gap this closes is that pattern living only as prose an operator must remember, with no
programmatic remote-state check that the merge actually landed.

Deliberately transport-shaped like ``simplicio_loop/github_lifecycle.py``: every GitHub call
goes through an injectable ``runner`` (default ``subprocess.run``) so unit tests can supply a
deterministic fake, and a real, non-mocked e2e is still possible by injecting the real
``subprocess.run`` against disposable scratch branches (see
``tests/test_merge_executor_live_e2e.py``).
