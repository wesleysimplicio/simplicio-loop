name: simplicio-prism
description: Route broad or ambiguous work across Simplicio Mapper, Fast, Dev CLI, Loop, and Runtime. Use when a request spans components, requires choosing the correct capability, needs an end-to-end workflow, or the agent is unsure which Simplicio skill to invoke. Prism classifies and composes; it does not execute mutations itself.

# Simplicio Prism

Use Prism as the top-level capability router. Read `references/capabilities.yaml` for routing rules and `references/recipes.md` for end-to-end compositions. Load a component skill only after Prism has selected it; do not duplicate component documentation here.

## Generate the complete interface map

Run the inventory generator against the actual checkout before relying on an interface:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_capability_inventory.py /path/to/repository \
  --output /path/to/repository/capability-inventory.json
python3 scripts/generate_capability_inventory.py \
  --validate /path/to/repository/capability-inventory.json
```

The inventory covers CLI entry points and subcommands, MCP registrations, public Python and Rust APIs, configuration files, inferred inputs/outputs/effects, observed errors and fallbacks, dependency/version data, compatibility, and cost estimates. Static cost and semantic contracts remain `requires_review` until measured or supplied in `capability-overrides.json`. Use `references/capability-record.schema.json` and `references/discovery.md` to interpret confidence.

## Routing algorithm

1. Classify intent as survey, retrieve, mutate, validate, orchestrate, govern, or mixed.
2. Check repository, revision, scope, availability, preconditions, and side-effect policy.
3. Select the smallest capability set and order dependencies before dependents.
4. Require Mapper before non-trivial mutation; require Dev CLI for mutation.
5. Add Fast for compatible repeated/large retrieval.
6. Add Loop for multi-step, parallel, retryable, or convergent work.
7. Add Runtime only for MCP, native execution, gates, receipts, checkpoints, backpressure, or governed subagents.
8. Emit a routing decision with reasons, fallbacks, and expected evidence.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Prism never edits files and never fabricates a capability.
- Unknown or unavailable capabilities become explicit `unresolved` items.
- Loop remains usable without Runtime.
- A reported success is not completion until the selected verifier proves it.
- Prefer the cheapest capability that satisfies the contract.

## Contract

Return `route_id`, `intent`, `selected_capabilities`, `order`, `preconditions`, `fallbacks`, `cost_estimate`, `evidence_requirements`, and `unresolved`.

## Resources

- `references/capabilities.yaml`: cross-component registry and decision matrix.
- `references/recipes.md`: tested compositions for common workflows.
- `scripts/probe-capabilities.py`: validate the registry and detect duplicate IDs.
